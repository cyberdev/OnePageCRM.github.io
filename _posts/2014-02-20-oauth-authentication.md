We are working on bring OAuth authentication to the OnePageCRM API.

To use the OAuth authentication, you will need to register an application.

To register an application, visit

Create your application and set a callback URL.

When you create your app, you will be show two long strings, your application id and secret.

Use these to test with your OAuth2 client.
